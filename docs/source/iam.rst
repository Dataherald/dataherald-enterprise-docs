Through the admin console, app administrators can access organization 
settings by doing the following:

#. Click on the Settings icon next to their user info on the bottom left of the Admin Console.
#. Click on the "Organization settings" button.

The data administrator will be directed to the "Organization Settings" page, 
where they can :ref:`add-data-admins` or :ref:`delete-data-admins`.
